Celery can be run inside a FastAPI application by integrating it into your application as a background task queue. This involves setting up a Celery instance, configuring it to work with your FastAPI application, and then adding Celery tasks to your application code. Here are the high-level steps to implement it:

Install Celery and the desired message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Redis)
Create a new Python file for Celery tasks and configure the Celery instance.
In the FastAPI application code, import the Celery instance and use it to decorate functions as Celery tasks.
Start the Celery worker in a separate terminal, or as a separate process using a process manager (e.g., Supervisor).
In your FastAPI code, trigger the Celery task by calling the task asynchronously and passing in the required arguments.
Here's an example of a basic implementation:

```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from celery import Celery

app = FastAPI()

def create_celery_app():
    celery_app = Celery("app", broker="redis://localhost:6379/0")
    celery_app.conf.update(
        task_default_queue="default",
        task_default_exchange="default",
        task_default_routing_key="default",
        task_serializer="json",
        accept_content=["json"],
        result_serializer="json",
        task_ignore_result=False,
    )
    return celery_app

celery_app = create_celery_app()

@app.post("/transcribe")
def transcribe_audio(payload: dict):
    file_name = payload.get("file_name")
    if not file_name:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="file_name is required")
    
    if not file_name.endswith(".mp3"):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="File must be of type .mp3")

    transcribe_audio_task.apply_async(args=[file_name])
    return {"status": "transcription started"}

# celery_tasks.py
from celery import Celery

celery_app = Celery("app", broker="redis://localhost:6379/0")

@celery_app.task
def transcribe_audio_task(file_name):
    # Perform the transcription here
    pass
```


In this example, the create_celery_app function sets up a new Celery instance and sets the necessary configuration options. The transcribe_audio function triggers the Celery task transcribe_audio_task by calling apply_async on it and passing in the required arguments. The transcribe_audio_task function performs the actual transcription. The Celery worker should be started in a separate terminal or process to handle the queued tasks.

Celery uses redis? Should I install redis as well?
Yes, Celery typically uses Redis as a message broker to manage and coordinate tasks. In order to use Celery with Redis, you need to install Redis on your system and configure it for use with Celery. This can involve adding the Redis host and port information to your Celery configuration file, and potentially installing any required libraries or dependencies. You may also need to set up Redis to run as a service on your system, depending on your specific setup.

Does pip install celery also handle redis installation?
No, installing Celery via pip does not handle Redis installation. You will need to install Redis separately. You can install Redis using the following command:

ruby
Copy code
$ pip install redis
Once you have installed Redis, you can configure your Celery instance to use it as a message broker.




Michal Vašulka
redis can be installed as python library with pip?
No, Redis is a separate software that needs to be installed independently, not as a python library through pip. You can install Redis by following the instructions on the official Redis website or using a package manager like apt-get or yum. After installation, you can configure and run Redis on your machine. Then, you can connect your Celery worker processes to the Redis instance to use it as a message broker.

But above you wrote that pip install redis will work.
No, "pip install redis" will not work. Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It is not a Python library and needs to be installed separately. You can follow the instructions on the official Redis website to install Redis on your system. After Redis is installed, you can use the python library "redis" to interact with the Redis server. You can install it using "pip install redis".
